- add setting icon and setting page
- add progress bar fill
- Auto setup the settings file. Most of the time the user wants to use the same settings as their osu game. Settings info are in osu!.username.cfg
- Actually pls use subprocess to call run_osu cause otherwise it will freeze the app. Using multithread will affect the performance I think.
- pls fix skin path missing slash
- When the user selected a .osr, the app should auto search for the beatmap too
- Resize makes the app lag pls fix
- When click button, show image click instead of image hover
- Fix button size
- Background blur when window popup
