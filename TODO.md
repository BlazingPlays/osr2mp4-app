# DO 
- add setting icon and setting page
- add progress bar fill
- Auto setup the settings file. Most of the time the user wants to use the same settings as their osu game. Settings info are in osu!.username.cfg
- Actually pls use subprocess to call run_osu cause otherwise it will freeze the app. Using multithread will affect the performance I think.
- Add shadow
- Button not right size, the mapset button should be smaller than osr button
- Error when click cancel select osr https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/609393632759250945/721709933954859018/Screenshot_2020-06-14_at_14.57.28.png
- Use height = self.width() * 9/16 instead of width = self.height() * 16/9 because of fullscreen issue
- Still no click image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/663830225532092416/721815056731602984/no_lick.mov
- Duplicated skin https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/663830225532092416/721815804504703036/Screenshot_2020-06-14_at_21.48.56.png

- Add min window size: 640x360, user can't resize window to be smaller than this.
- osr path and mapset path font is not resizing, it's too small at fullscreeen: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/663830225532092416/721816654492860546/Screenshot_2020-06-14_at_21.50.57.png, and too big at 640x360: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/663830225532092416/721816815340355636/Screenshot_2020-06-14_at_22.02.09.png
